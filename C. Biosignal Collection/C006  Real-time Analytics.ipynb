In fact, most of the tasks that we perform on a daily basis, including those that keep us alive (e.g. breathing), are only possible due to an intricate network of strategically arranged muscle fibers scattered across our body (and fortunately there are quite a few). Although for us the whole processes are almost innate and instinctive, the knobs and gears turning inside our body to do so are quite remarkable. Whenever we perform an action that involves the use of our muscles, the visible results are actually the response to a burst of electrical stimuli being fired onto the muscle fibers in the follow-up of command signals sent by the brain. For example, our brain has a cluster of nerve cells dedicated to the handling of motor activity (the upper motor neurons); a single motor neuron can control thousands of muscle fibers, in the case of large muscles like the biceps, or only a few dozens, in the case of fine muscles like the ones that control our eyes. Once issued by the upper motor neurons, the control signals are propagated through the spinal cord down to the lower motor neurons, located in the spinal cord. In turn, the lower motor neurons trigger an action potential, which causes an electrochemical reaction in the interface between the nerve and the muscle fiber, ultimately leading to the muscle contraction.\n", "    \n", "            Illustration of the circuit between the upper motor neurons (where the sequence of steps to perform a given motor task is triggered) and the muscle fibers:\n", "\n", "<img src=\"attachment:Motoneuron.png\" width=\"450\">\n", "\n", "Source: http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Motorneuron"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["    This otherwise long story has a pretty straightforward outline: you think of an action (and in some bodily functions do not even need to think), messages are sent by the brain to the muscles, the muscle fibers are bombed with electrochemical activation impulses (aka action potentials), voltage imbalances are originated within the muscle cells causing them to contract, and all these actions happen quicker than a blink of an eye (in just a few  milliseconds).

As a whole the process is known as Electromyography (EMG), a term that derives from electro (i.e. related to or caused by electricity), myo (i.e. combining form of muscles), and graphy (i.e. descriptive outcome). As measured on the body surface, EMG signals are typically in the order of millivolt or even microvolt (i.e. 1000 to 10000 times less voltage than what is used to power your phone), depending on the number of fibers composing the muscle being measured, which is inherently related with their size. Given the feeble nature of EMG signals, they are  quite sensitive to noise sources (e.g. motion artifacts or electromagnetic interferences), and usually signal conditioning procedures are needed to obtain a workable resulting output."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## <div style=\"color:#fbb144;\">  1.3. Electrodes and Their Placement  </div>\n", "\n", "    The first step in the process of muscle sensing is the interface between the electronic circuitry and the muscle (aka electrode), which mainly seeks to maximize the electrical conductivity, and minimize mechanical artifacts (through adherence). There are two major classes of EMG in what concerns the electrode placement, namely the intramuscular EMG  (iEMG) and surface EMG (sEMG). In iEMG, fine wire needle electrodes (fully insulated except at the tip) are used to penetrate through the skin, and the goal is muscule activity measurement at the fiber level. In sEMG, the electrodes are placed at the skin surface and the goal is to measure the muscle activity non-invasively, albeit as an aggregate  activity with contribution from all muscle groups and fibers in the vicinity of the electrode placement. Thw following figure shows the anatomy of a medical-grade sEMG electrode, including Silver/SilverChloride (Ag/AgCl) pad, conductive  gel, support substrate with adhesive to hold the electrode in place, and other important components to obtain maximum  signal quality.\n", " \n", "            Anatomy of a medical-grade sEMG electrode:\n", "<img src=\"https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientIST-notebooks/blob/master/_Resources/Images/C.Signal_Processing_IMG/c006/EMGelectrode.png?raw=true\" width=\"450\">\n", "\n", "\n", "    Although for specialized applications medical-grade electrodes are important, they have several shortcomings, chief  among which are the fact that the adhesive material wears off quickly upon continued use, and that the gel often leaves inconvenient residues in the skin.

Alternative materials include the use of the dry Ag/AgCl electrode core alone, conductive lycra fabrics, conductive ink (e.g. Bare Conductive1 ), stainless steel pads, silver or gold bars, among several others.

As mentioned in Section 7.4.1, action potentials generate voltage imbalances with respect to a baseline (resting) potential. By means of EMG, such an effect can be captured by measuring the voltage difference between one electrode placed on the muscle of interest (or signal) and one electrode placed on an electrically neutral area (the reference) [2]. Given that both electrodes can be far apart, often it happens that the signal electrode is being affected by noise sources that are not affecting the reference electrode in the same way; in order to mitigate this issue and improve the signal quality, EMG signals are typically measured using a bipolar sensor setup. In a bipolar setup, the reference electrode is placed as described before, however, instead of a single signal electrode two differential signal electrodes are used, namely a positive signal lead (IN+) and a negative signal lead (IN- ), and the EMG is measured as the difference between each of the two leads and the reference. With this approach, most noise sources affecting the signal electrode and not the reference are present in both the positive and negative signal leads and canceled or greatly attenuated through the difference between the two. The positive and negative signal leads should ideally be placed over the muscle belly, aligned with the beam of muscle fibers and with 2cm spacing between electrodes. Typical locations for the reference electrode include the elbow, vertebrae, knee, and areas where bone is similarly abundant, however, there are applications (e.g. human-computer interaction), in which the placement of the reference electrode can be relaxed to improve usability and facilitate sensor integration (e.g. can be placed near the positive and negative signal leads), and in many modern sensor designs it may even be unnecessary.\n", "\n", "            Illustration of the positive (IN+), negative (IN-) and reference (REF) leads placement in a bipolar configuration for EMG data sensing: \n", "                    IN+ and IN- leads placement\n", "\n", "<img src=\"https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientIST-notebooks/blob/master/_Resources/Images/C.Signal_Processing_IMG/c006/EMGplacement.png?raw=true\" width=\"200\">\n", "\n", "                    Reference lead placement:                    \n", "<img src=\"https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientIST-notebooks/blob/master/_Resources/Images/C.Signal_Processing_IMG/c006/EMGreference.png?raw=true\" width=\"200\">\n", "\n", "Source:\n", "  <a> http://www.bartleby.com </a>"]}, {"attachments": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["### <div style=\"color:#fbb144;\">3.3.
