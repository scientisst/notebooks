ScientISST Notebooks is a repository of educational content both teachers and learners, within the field of Biomedical Engineering - with a focus on biosignals and their applications in health.

The structure of the repository transpires the **duality** of our purpose: the contents are separated by knowledge area (for anyone that wishes to learn about a certain topic), as well as by academic courses (to be used and adapted by teachers for their courses). 

## Courses
The program of the courses that we currently support can be found in the following links:
- [IEB - Introduction to Biomedical Engineering](https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientISST-notebooks/blob/master/_Courses/IST-UL-IEB-IntroductiontoBiomedicalEngineering.md) - ```Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa```
- [TMED - Telemedicine](https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientISST-notebooks/blob/master/_Courses/IPS-ESS-TMED-Telemedicine.md) - ```Escola Superior de Tecnologia de Setúbal, IPS```
- [IAS - Signal Acquisition Instrumentation in Bioengineering](./_Courses/IST-UL-IAS-SignalAcquisitionInstrumentationinBioengineering.MD) - ```Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa```
- [MLB - Machine Learning in Bioengineering](https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientISST-notebooks/blob/master/_Courses/IST-UL-MLB-MachineLearninginBioengineering.md) - ```Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa```

## The Journey of a Biosignal
Our approach is anchored on the _journey of a biosignal_: from its genesis by the recording of physiological parameter to its use on a real-world problem. The following infograph illustrates how the structure of this root repository emphasizes the different steps of that journey:
