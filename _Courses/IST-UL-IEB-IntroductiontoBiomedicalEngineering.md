# Introduction of Biomedical Engineering (IBE)
```Mestrado Integrado em Engenharia Biomédica``` | ```Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa``` | ```2021-2022```

## Description & Objectives

The course [Introduction to Biomedical Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/IEB/2021-2022/2-semestre/) 
an overview of the field of biomedical engineering, covering basic concepts and practical applications. Students will
explore different areas, such as biomaterials, biotechnology, artificial organs, bioinformatics, biomechanics,
instrumentation, diagnosis techniques, hospital management, and acquisition and processing of biomedical signals.
Through the analysis of practical cases, students will gain critical thinking skills and understand the role of
biomedical engineers in developing new technologies and improving healthcare. The course also promotes teamwork and
communication skills, as students will work in groups to solve a practical case study and present their results in oral 
and written formats. The course aims:
- To introduce students to the area of biomedical engineering and its various perspectives, including scientific/research and practical/clinical.
- To provide students with basic concepts through the analysis of typical practical cases, stimulating critical analysis skills.
- To promote soft skills, such as teamwork and problem-solving, through the practical case study, with the presentation and discussion of results in oral and written formats.
