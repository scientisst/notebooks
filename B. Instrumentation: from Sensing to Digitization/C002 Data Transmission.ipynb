Any communication process always involves a transmitter (e.g. you) and a receiver (e.g. your colleague), which can generally change roles, but also a channel (e.g. air), through which the message is conveyed. In this lesson we will experiment with digital data transmission, in particular, using the computer as the transmitter/receiver, the Arduino as the receiver/transmitter, the asynchronous serial communication protocol as the \u201clanguage\u201d for them to understand each other, and the hardwired USB connection as the channel through which they communicate."]}, {"attachments": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<img src=\"https://github.com/PIA-Group/ScientIST-notebooks/blob/master/_Resources/Images/C.Signal_Processing_IMG/c002/SerialCommunication.png?raw=true\" width=\"450\">"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["<div style=\"background:#946db2;font-family:'arial', monospace; text-align: center; padding: 10px 0; border-radius:10px; width:70%; margin:auto \" >\n", "  <span style=\"font-size:20px;position:relative;color:white; \"> Explore </span> <br>\n", "  <div style=\"background:#d0b3e6;font-size:12px\"> \n", "https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/serial-communication   \n", "</div>"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## <div style=\"color:#fbb144;\"> 2.
