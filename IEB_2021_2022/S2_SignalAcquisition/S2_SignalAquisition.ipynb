    "\n",
    "Most biosignals are of low amplitude: for example, at the body surface, ECG amplitude can vary from 0.5 to 4 $\\textrm{mV}$ and EEG from 5 to 300 $\\mu\\textrm{V}$. However, in order to properly record this type of low-amplitude signals, amplification is often necessary, which consists of increasing the amplitude of the signal by a given scale factor (known as gain). This is done by circuits especially designed for this purpose. For ECG signals, instrumentation amplifiers generally have voltage gains ($G_v$) in the order of thousands:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G_v = \\frac{\\Delta v_{out}}{\\Delta v_{in}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using a voltage gain $G_v = 1000$, a signal with an amplitude of $\\pm$1 mV will have its amplitude increased to $\\pm$1 V (see figure below). Note that the frequency remains unchanged.\n",

    "<img src=\"resources/amplification.png\" style=\"width:70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### <div style=\"color:#fbb144\"> 2.2. Sampling </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Biosignal acquisition instruments convert analog (continuous) signals into a digital representation through a process known as sampling, which consists of collecting instantaneous magnitude values of a signal in time or space, thus creating a discrete representation of it. This operation is usually done with a fixed interval between samples (see figure below). In the time domain, this interval is the sampling period ($T_s$), which is the inverse of the sampling frequency ($f_s$), measured in Hertz (Hz):\n",

    "### <div style=\"color:#fbb144\"> 2.3. Quantization </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital systems have a limited resolution, reason for which each sampled magnitude is rounded to an integer value, through a process known as quantization. The resolution is defined by the number of bits of the ADC ($n$) and by its operating voltage ($\\textrm{Vref}$).  The number of bits determines the number of quantization levels, which is given by $2^n$, and the voltage \"gap\" in-between each level corresponds to the amplitude resolution of the ADC, which is given by $\\frac{\\textrm{Vref}}{2^n}$. Since the quantization levels are within the operating voltage of the ADC, voltage measurements outside this range will saturate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 4-bit ADC with a -1.25 to 1.25 Volt (V) operating voltage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can represent a total of $2^{4} = 16$ discrete values (digital codes)\n",
    "* Each value corresponds to a voltage level of $\\frac{2.5 \\ \\textrm{(V)}}{16}=156.25 \\ \\textrm{mV}$ (amplitude resolution of the ADC)\n",

    "Using this example, the figure below represents the quantization process applied to the previous signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/quantization_new.png\" style=\"width:70%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sampled value is rounded to the nearest quantization level (left axis), which corresponds to a given voltage value that the ADC can record (right axis). However, by default, the ADC does not output the amplitude values in their real-world physical units, instead it only presents the digital codes assigned by the ADC ($0, 1, ..., 2^n-1$). To be able to convert these values into amplitude, the ADC's transfer function is needed. The ideal (linear) version of an ADC's transfer function is given by:\n",

By injecting this signal into the same ECG sensors, an acquisition was performed using the ScientISST board configured with a sampling rate of 500 Hz. The `reference.txt` file contains the ADC values recorded by the board. Given this, read the file and estimate the gain of the ECG sensor using the formula from the previous exercise."
