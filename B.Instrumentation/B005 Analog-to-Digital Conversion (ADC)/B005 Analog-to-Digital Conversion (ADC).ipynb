This is done by mapping the voltage to a set of digital codes using a finite number of **bits**. \n","\n","On the Seeeduino board, the ADC pins have an `A` as a prefix of their label (`A0` through `A7`), to indicate these pins can read analog voltages.\n","\n","<img src=\"./_Resources/seeeduino-analog-ports.png\" width=\"500\" border=\"0\">\n","<p style=\"color:#484848;text-align:center\"> <i> Figure 1: Highlight of the analog ports on the Seeeduino Nano (A0 to A7). </i> </p>\n","\n","\n","Some of the relevant specifications of an ADC are _resolution_, _voltage range_ and _quantization noise_ [[1]](#principles):\n","\n","##### <div style=\"color:#484848\"> Resolution </div>\n","\n","Resolution specifies the number of different values that the output of the ADC can have (with _bits_ as the unit). In the example of the digital port (**1-bit**) we represent the input voltage at the pin with a set of **two discrete levels** $[0, 1]$. Expanding the number of bits, also increases our representation space. For example using **2 bits**, if we consider all the possible states ($00$, $01$, $11$, $10$) we have a representation space of **four discrete levels**, i.e. $[0, 1, 2, 3]$). \n","\n","In a more general form, the representation space will have $2^n$ discrete levels, with $n$ being the resolution of the ADC.\n","\n","ADCs can vary greatly between microcontroller. The ADC on the Arduino has $n=10$-bit ADC meaning it has the ability to map the analog input voltage to $2^{12} = 1024$ ($0$ to $1023$) discrete levels.
